Android Final Project - Restaurant Suggestion:
This app takes in your preferences and outputs the best restaurants for you in University City!!

Medium functions:â€¨
- shared preference for your answers
- radio group for the choices
- menu item for reseting preferences
- three activities: choose your preferences, display restaurant suggestions, maps activity

Hard functions:
- google maps API to display the suggested app
- Zomato API: generates all information to a given restaurant

I decided to only give one option because that's the point of the app - for those who can't choose. Also, the food truck function is a bit quirky sometimes because there are many times where I have no idea where those are, that's just a problem with the API.

I have also added a little bit of randomness to it, so people get different restaurants!

Finally, I didn't hardcode any restaurants in there, so all the restaurants are in the range of the entire Philadelphia.
